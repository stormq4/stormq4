#                                                   Hi there 👋 I'm Storm

##                                      I am studying software engineering at Codam Coding College

- 📕 I have a degree in Industrial Engineering & Management and now I am following the core-curriculum from the 42 Network

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: **ft_containers (building my own vector, map and stack with the benchmark almost as good to the regular ones written in CPP) and  Mini-RT (Building my own mini raytracer, while applying concurrency written in C)**

- 👯 In the next comming months I will be learning: **Docker, Typescript (for backend and frontend), Kubernetes and moreeeee C++**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: **Unit-testing, Integration-testing && Data structures**

- ✅ Projects I recently finished: **philosophers (solved a problem using threads and learned concurrency), pipex (writing my own pipe (|) function), fdf (Wireframe representation of a 3d map), minishell (building my own basic bash like shell in c) and the CPP_Modules (learning crucial knowledge on CPP)**

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love playing Padel 🏸
